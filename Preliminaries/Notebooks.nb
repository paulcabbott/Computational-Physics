At the time I was using Xcode, which had a terminal-like interface that was a \
plain text document in which you could put all the shell commands you needed \
to build your app. This could include calls to the compiler, linker, or just \
any generic shell commands. To evaluate a given command (which could be one \
or more lines long) you had to manually select the exact range of text you \
wanted to run, which was kind of irritating. Any output would be placed \
directly below the input line. Because the document was pure plain text, it \
had no way of knowing what was input and what was output, or distinguish new \
output from old. So all the outputs accumulated, and you had to manually \
select and delete them periodically. It was an improvement over a glass \
teletype terminal interface, but I thought I could do better for Mathematica \
(code name Omega at the time).\

The solution I came up with was to create a text document that was annotated \
with \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]zones\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] delimited by \
vertical bars along the right side of the screen (where cell brackets are \
now). Initially I used different black and white texture patterns on 4 or 5 \
pixel wide vertical bars. One texture for input and another texture for output.
This immediately gave two huge advantages: first, you didn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t \
have to manually select the range of a multi-line input. Just putting the \
cursor anywhere within an input zone and evaluating would evaluate the whole \
input. Second, because the system was keeping track of what was output, old \
output could be deleted automatically and replaced with new output.\
\>", "Text",ExpressionUUID->"43202de1-3caf-4748-bff1-3edc2d4ecce2"],

Cell["\<\
Initially I called these things zones, but Steve Jobs suggested I use large \
close-square-bracket symbols instead of patterned bars, and think of them \
more like cells in a spreadsheet than like zones in a text document. Once you \
have brackets instead of bars, it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s immediately obvious that \
you could have larger brackets that encompass two or more cells. So I created \
cell groups, initially just to group input/output pairs, but of course it\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s not a big leap to also have sections and subsections, \
then different cell types, styles, graphics cells, etc.
These key defining features of notebooks did not exist in any other system at \
the time, and to the best of my knowledge were not independently developed by \
other people. All the current notebook systems that share these broad \
features, definitely including Jupyter notebooks, derive from the original \
Mathematica notebooks I developed in 1987-8. (There are other styles of user \
interface, including some used by Maple and Matlab around the same time, that \
are called notebooks, but they did not share the key features I\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]ve described. They were and are fine products that I\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]m sure have both advantages and disadvantages compared to \
our Notebooks, but unlike our Notebooks, they are not the precursors of \
Jupyter.)\

The notebook interface was the brainchild of Theodore Gray, who was inspired \
while working with an old Apple code editor. Where most programming \
environments either had you run code one line at a time, or all at once as a \
big blob, the Apple editor let you highlight any part of your code and run \
just that part. Gray brought the same basic concept to Mathematica, with help \
refining the design from none other than Steve Jobs. The notebook is designed \
to turn scientific programming into an interactive exercise, where individual \
commands were tweaked and rerun, perhaps dozens or hundreds of times, as the \
author learned from the results of their little computational experiments, \
and came to a more intimate understanding of their data.\

What made Mathematica\[CloseCurlyQuote]s notebook especially suited to the \
task was its ability to generate plots, pictures, and beautiful mathematical \
formulas, and to have this output respond dynamically to changes in the code. \
In Mathematica you can input a voice recording, run complex mathematical \
filters over the audio, and visualize the resulting sound wave; just by \
mousing through and adjusting parameters, you can warp the wave, discovering \
which filters work best by playing around. Mathematica\[CloseCurlyQuote]s \
ability to fluidly handle so many different kinds of computation in a single, \
simple interface is the result, Gray says, of \

P\[EAcute]rez combined the three projects into one and took the reins. From \
the very beginning, the project, called IPython (the \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] for \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Interactive\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]), was open-source: It wasn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t just \
that the program was free, but that anyone could inspect its code and modify \
it, contributing their changes back to the common cause. It was a deliberate \
decision. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I was interested in both the ethical aspect \
of being able to share my work with others,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] \
P\[EAcute]rez told me he came from Colombia, where access to proprietary \
software was harder to come by \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]and there was also a \
more epistemological motivation.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] He thought that if \
science was to be an open enterprise, the tools that are used to do it should \
themselves be open. Commercial software whose source code you were legally \
prohibited from reading was \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]antithetical to the idea \
of science,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] where the very purpose is to open the \
black box of nature.\

Hence the allure of Python. Out of the box, Python is a much less powerful \
language than the Wolfram Language that powers Mathematica. But where \
Mathematica gets its powers from an army of Wolfram Research programmers, \
Python\[CloseCurlyQuote]s bare-bones core is supplemented by a massive \
library of extra features for processing images, making music, building AIs, \
analyzing language, graphing data sets built by a community of open-source \
contributors working for free. Python became a de facto standard for \
scientific computing because open-source developers like P\[EAcute]rez \
happened to build useful tools for it; and open-source developers have \
flocked to Python because it happens to be the de facto standard for \
scientific computing. Programming-language communities, like any social \
network, thrive or die on the strength of these feedback loops.\

Cell["\<\
The idea for IPython\[CloseCurlyQuote]s notebook interface came from \
Mathematica. P\[EAcute]rez admired the way that Mathematica notebooks \
encouraged an exploratory style. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]You would sketch \
something out because that\[CloseCurlyQuote]s how you reason about a problem, \
that\[CloseCurlyQuote]s how you understand a problem.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] \
Computational notebooks, he said, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]bring that idea of \
live narrative out ... You can think through the process, and you\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]re effectively using the computer, if you will, as a \
computational partner, and as a thinking partner.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\
\[LineSeparator]\[LineSeparator]Instead of building a specialized, \
stand-alone application, let alone spending man-centuries on it, the IPython \
team P\[EAcute]rez was now joined by Brian Granger, a physics professor at \
California Polytechnic State University at San Luis Obispo; and Min \
Ragan-Kelley, a Ph.D. student at UC Berkeley working in computational physics \
built their notebooks as simple web pages. The interface is missing \
Mathematica\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Steve Jobsian polish, and its sophistication. \
But by latching itself to the web, IPython got what is essentially free \
labor: Any time Google, Apple, or a random programmer open-sourced a new \
plotting tool, or published better code for rendering math, the improvement \
would get rolled into IPython. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]It has paid off \
handsomely,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] P\[EAcute]rez said.\[LineSeparator]\
\[LineSeparator]The paper announcing the first confirmed detection of \
gravitational waves was published in the traditional way, as a PDF, but with \
a supplemental IPython notebook. The notebook walks through the work that \
generated every figure in the paper. Anyone who wants to can run the code for \
themselves, tweaking parts of it as they see fit, playing with the \
calculations to get a better handle on how each one works. At a certain point \
in the notebook, it gets to the part where the signal that generated the \
gravitational waves is processed into sound, and this you can play in your \
browser, hearing for yourself what the scientists heard first, the bloop of \
two black holes colliding.\[LineSeparator]\[LineSeparator]\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I think what they have is acceptance from the \
scientific community as a tool that is considered to be universal,\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Theodore Gray says of \
P\[EAcute]rez\[CloseCurlyQuote]s group. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]And that\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s the thing that Mathematica never really so far has \
achieved.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] There are now 1.3 million of these \
notebooks hosted publicly on Github. They\[CloseCurlyQuote]re in use at \
Google, Bloomberg, and NASA; by musicians, teachers, and AI researchers; and \
in \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]almost every country on Earth.\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\[LineSeparator]\[LineSeparator]At every turn, \
IPython chose the way that was more inclusive, to the point where it\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s no longer called \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]IPython\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]: The project rebranded itself as \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Jupyter\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] in 2014 to recognize \
the fact that it was no longer just for Python. The Jupyter notebook, as it\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s called, is like a Mathematica notebook but for any \
programming language. You can have a Python notebook, or a C notebook, or an \
R notebook, or Ruby, or Javascript, or Julia. Anyone can build support for \
their programming language in Jupyter. Today it supports more than 100 \
languages.\[LineSeparator]\[LineSeparator]Theodore Gray, who developed the \
original Mathematica notebook interface, said that he once as an experiment \
tried to build support for other programming languages into it. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]It never went anywhere,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he \
told me. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The company had no interest in supporting \
this. And also because when you have to support a lot of different languages, \
you can\[CloseCurlyQuote]t do it as deeply.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\
\[LineSeparator]\[LineSeparator]A 1997 essay by Eric S. Raymond titled \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The Cathedral and the Bazaar,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] \
in some sense the founding document of the modern open-source movement, \
challenged the notion that complex software had to be built like a cathedral, \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]carefully crafted by individual wizards or small bands \
of mages working in splendid isolation.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Raymond\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s experience as one of the stewards of the Linux kernel (a \
piece of open-source software that powers all of the world\[CloseCurlyQuote]s \
500 most powerful supercomputers, and the vast majority of mobile devices) \
taught him that the \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]great babbling bazaar of differing \
agendas and approaches\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] that defined open-source \
projects was actually a strength. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The fact that this \
bazaar style seemed to work, and work well, came as a distinct shock,\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he wrote. The essay was his attempt to reckon with \
why \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]the Linux world not only didn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t \
fly apart in confusion but seemed to go from strength to strength at a speed \
barely imaginable to cathedral builders.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\
\[LineSeparator]\[LineSeparator]Mathematica was in development long before \
Raymond\[CloseCurlyQuote]s formative experience with Linux, and has been in \
development long after it. It is the quintessential cathedral, and its \
builders are still skeptical of the bazaar. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]There\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s always chaos,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Gray said about \
open-source systems. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The number of moving parts is so \
vast, and several of them are under the control of different groups. There\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s no way you could ever pull it together into an integrated \
system in the same way as you can in a single commercial product with, you \
know, a single maniac in the middle.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\[LineSeparator]\
\[LineSeparator]The maniac is, of course, Stephen Wolfram. Gray pointed out \
that the trains ran on time under Mussolini. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]It\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s a bad analogy,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he said, but \
still, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m all in favor of there \
being a maniac in the middle.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] The Mathematica \
notebook is the more coherently designed, more polished product in large part \
because every decision that went into building it emanated from the mind of a \
single, opinionated genius. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I see these Jupyter guys,\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Wolfram said to me, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]they are \
about on a par with what we had in the early 1990s.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] \
They\[CloseCurlyQuote]ve taken shortcuts, he said. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]We \
actually want to try and do it right.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\[LineSeparator]\
\[LineSeparator]But it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s hard to sell the scientific \
community on a piece of commercial software. Even though Wolfram Research has \
given away a free Mathematica notebook viewer for years, and even though most \
major universities already have a site license that lets their students and \
faculty use Mathematica freely, it might be too much to ask publishers to \
abandon PDFs, an open format, for a proprietary product. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Right now if you make a Mathematica notebook and you \
try to send that to a journal,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Gray says, \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]they\[CloseCurlyQuote]re gonna complain: Well, we don\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t have Mathematica, this is an expensive product give us \
something that\[CloseCurlyQuote]s more of a standard.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\
\[LineSeparator]\[LineSeparator]It doesn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t help that Wolfram \
the man, and to some extent the company touts Mathematica\[CloseCurlyQuote]s \
superiority, its necessity, in a way that even Gray describes as being a bit \
like how CrossFit people won\[CloseCurlyQuote]t shut up about CrossFit. This \
is, after all, the same Stephen Wolfram who titled a book about his own work \
on cellular automata A New Kind of Science. In his blog post about \
computational essays, he writes, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]At the core of \
computational essays is the idea of expressing computational thoughts using \
the Wolfram Language.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Which, who knows, might well be \
true maybe computational notebooks will only take root if they\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]re backed by a single super-language, or by a company with \
deep pockets and a vested interest in making them work. But it seems just as \
likely that the opposite is true. A federated effort, while more chaotic, \
might also be more robust and the only way to win the trust of the scientific \
community.\

When you improve the praxis of science, the dream is that you\

notation, by making it easier to do calculus, expanded the space of what it \
was possible to think. The grand scientific challenges of our day are as \
often as not computational puzzles: How to integrate billions of base pairs \
of genomic data, and 10 times that amount of proteomic data, and historical \
patient data, and the results of pharmacological screens into a coherent \
account of how somebody got sick and what to do to make them better? How to \
make actionable an endless stream of new temperature and precipitation data, \
and oceanographic and volcanic and seismic data? How to build, and make sense \
of, a neuron-by-neuron map of a thinking brain? Equipping scientists with \
computational notebooks, or some evolved form of them, might bring their \
minds to a level with problems now out of reach.\

Mathematica\[CloseCurlyQuote]s notebook definitely strongly inspired Colab\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s notebook. Colab is an implementation of the Jupyter \
notebook format and UI. Jupyter, which launched around 2011, itself was \
strongly inspired by (1) the IPython console from around 2003, and (2) the \
Sage Notebook which I launched around 2006.
I can tell you definitively that Sage Notebook is very Mathematica inspired. \
The IPython console looked a lot like Mathematica, mainly because Fernando \
Perez (who was a physicist) had used Mathematica a lot and wanted something \
similar but (much) better. In 2005 there was a project to make an IPython \
notebook interface as an OS X graphical application, which got demoed at Sage \
Day 1 (in Feb 2006). That motivated me to get interested in doing something \
similar, but using Javascript and HTML instead. I hired Alex Clemesha, who \
just finished his physics undergrad and was a heavy Mathematica user to work \
on Sage fulltime. He did a lot of work with me during 2006 to create a \
web-based notebook interface (and also to provide a mathematica-like graphics \
compatibility layer for Python, which is in Sage). The Sage notebook felt \
pretty similar in 2007 to what Jupyter notebook feels like, and it definitely \
inspired the UI. We developed Sage notebook heavily and then all sort of lost \
interest and moved on to other things (e.g., Jason Grout, who was involved a \
lot with the Sage notebook went to work at Bloomberg, where he did a massive \
amount of work on JupyterLab). Fortunately, Fernando Perez and others got \
incredible grant support and many fantastic engineers together built the \
Jupyter notebook. Jupyter notebook provided the same sort of cell/output UI \
as we had with the Sage notebook, but was much more general purpose (many \
kernels) and used more \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]modern\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] \
implementation techniques, by 2011 standards at least.\

There\[CloseCurlyQuote]s a lot of amazing things about the Mathematica \
notebook that we never even tried to implement. For example, Mathematica has \
a much more sophisticated nested structure. Also, by default Mathematica \
shares one kernel across multiple notebooks (or at least it did last time I \
tried it).\

Just to finish the story, in 2013 I started CoCalc to make a fully realtime \
collaborative notebook interface. Around the same time, many other people \
started another project called JupyterLab that reimplemented a Jupyter \
notebook client using much more powerful modern approaches. In addition, \
there\[CloseCurlyQuote]s a lot more going on regarding notebook clients these \
days, including Nteract, Kaggle kernels, and http://deepnote.com/. Some \
people like me who work on these surely played around a lot with Mathematica \
notebooks when they were kids :-).\
